# Add debug capability to rebuild database metadata

Sometimes I update the format of database entry metadata (e.g. spells getting more metadata fields) but dont want to delete and redownload modules. There should be a button I can access (or console command perhaps?) to have the application load each entry of a given category, and regenerate the metadata from the saved kdl.
