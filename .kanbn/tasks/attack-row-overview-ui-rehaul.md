# Attack row overview UI rehaul

Rehaul attack rows to a format similar to spells. This should also display the total bonuses to attack roll and damage in the overview (e.g. damage `1d6 + 8`)
Also, the attack actions are not currently pulling bonuses from the derived data; it should be querying for weapon attack and damage alterations (bonuses and roll modifiers)
