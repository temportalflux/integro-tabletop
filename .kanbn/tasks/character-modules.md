# Character Modules

- Each character has a list of modules that are used
- Populated with defaults specified in the user's settings when a new character is created
- Can add or remove modules in the editor for a character
- a character's module list can be auto-updated/autosync'd when the character is opened (see `use_update_character_modules`)
