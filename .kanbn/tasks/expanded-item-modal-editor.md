# Expanded item modal editor

edit capability for properties:
name, notes, quantity(✔)
dndbeyond also supports worth and weight overrides, idk if I want that or not

buttons for:
(un)equip(✔), sell(?), (un)attune, move (between containers)
button to convert into custom item, which enables full control over all properties. Or maybe this just uses some `inheiret` property and allows user to override any property after copying from some source id.
