# Generate integration tests from local modules

https://blog.cyplo.dev/posts/2018/12/generate-rust-tests-from-data/

Add changes to the build script to generate an integration test for every source file in the `modules` directory, so that every content file is tested for validity without needing to open the site and try updating from data.
