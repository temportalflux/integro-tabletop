# Pact Weapon Identifier & Query

Eldritch Invocation "Lifedrinker" needs to be able to query what weapon is the pact weapon.

Concept: new mutator functionality

- a mutator which adds a user-assignable tag
- tag can be limited to n-items
- users can tag items in their inventory
- pact weapon feature grants the Pact Weapon tag for 1 item at a time
- features can query the user-assigned tags on items to conditionally apply modifications
