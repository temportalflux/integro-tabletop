# Spellcasting limited by both slot and uses at the same time

e.g. Eldritch Invocation "Bewitching Whispers", "Dreadful Word", "Minions of Chaos", "Mire the Mind", "Sculptor of Flesh", "Sign of Ill Omen", & "Thief of Five Fates"

"You can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest."
