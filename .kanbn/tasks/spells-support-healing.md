# Spells support healing

Spells can be annotated with a healing property, which is shown on the overview (maybe in place of damage?).
Spells with healing can be queried and bonuses granted to the healing amount.

- Grant an extra (evaluated) amount of hp per spell that grants healing (2 + the spell's rank)
