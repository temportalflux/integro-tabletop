# Updated module actions

Split work into actual tasks:
- Can open a module modal to delete or perform other actions
- Deleting a module requires that it is not used by any locally installed characters
- Modules can be in the database without being installed. Users can select which modules they install out of all those they have access to.
- (action) check for updates; query for any new revisions/commits
- (action) clone module from its source to a user's own homebrew
