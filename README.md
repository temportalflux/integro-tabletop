# Integro Tabletop
-----

integro (latin) - start from scratch, begin again, crecreate, renew

Integro Tabletop is a client-only web application used to facilitate stats traditionally tracked by pen-and-paper in tabletop games. Its creation was catalyzed by the desire to have a character sheet app where:
- one's data could be owned by the author, while used by many
- the app could run without a backend server controlling the data
- features could be added by open-source contributors instead of being closed-source

Integro only currently supports the D&D 5e tabletop game (and only for character sheets) - and even that support is still in its fledgeling state.
