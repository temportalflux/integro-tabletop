Circle of the Blighted
Those who channel the magic of life and nature
often find themselves drawn to a particular shrine
or natural site, binding their body and spirit to these
places of power. Such druids draw vitality from their
chosen location, protecting it with their lives—but not
all succeed in defending these sacred realms.
Whether through the subtle corruption of vile
magics, the tainted presence of an ancient terror, or
a terrible mistake unleashed by druids themselves, a
land can become cursed with magic that warps any
druid bound to that land. Twisted by their connection
to an unhallowed territory, these guardians come to
embody the defiled nature they serve, exalting the
natural process of decay and using it to further their
goals—or sometimes to seek a means to end the
curse that plagues them.
Defile Ground
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this circle,
you can use a bonus action to corrupt a patch of land
or an area of water in a 10-foot radius centered on a
point within 60 feet of you. This corruption lasts for
1 minute. The corrupted area is difficult terrain for
creatures that are hostile to you. Additionally, when a
creature in the area takes damage from an attack or
spell for the first time on a turn, it takes an extra 1d4

necrotic damage. You can move this patch of corrup-
tion up to 30 feet as a bonus action. Flying creatures

are unaffected by the corruption.
Starting at 10th level, the area of your defiled
ground increases to a 20-foot radius. Additionally,
the extra damage dealt by your defiled ground
increases to 1d6 when you reach 10th level in this
class, and 1d8 at 14th level.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
Blighted Shape
Also at 2nd level, your physical form begins to show
effects of the corruption you wield, tracing blackened
veins across your skin, producing gnarled, bony
protrusions, or other eerie phenomena. You gain
proficiency in the Charisma (Intimidation) skill.
Additionally, while you are transformed by your
Wild Shape feature, you gain a +2 bonus to AC as
gnarled spines protrude from your body. Your beast
form also gains darkvision with a radius of 60 feet,
or an additional 60 feet of darkvision if it already has
that sense.
Call of the Shadowseeds
At 6th level, you learn to summon the feral children
of the forest from the life force of your enemies.
When a creature that is not undead or a construct
takes damage within the area of your Defile Ground
feature, you can use your reaction to summon a
blighted sapling in an unoccupied space within 5 feet
of the creature. You can direct the sapling to make
an attack against any creature within 5 feet of it as
a part of this reaction. The sapling then acts on your
initiative, obeying your verbal commands.
The blighted sapling remains in your service until
it’s reduced to 0 hit points, until the end of your next
long rest, or until you summon another sapling, at
which point it crumbles into foul-smelling mulch. You
can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when
you finish a long rest.

The sapling uses the accompanying blighted sap-
ling stat block. Its features scale based on your level

and proficiency bonus (PB).

Foul Conjuration
Starting at 10th level, the creatures you conjure are
malformed and bloated with toxins. Any beast, fey,
or plant (including your blighted sapling) summoned
or created by your spells or class features gains the
following traits:
Blighted Resilience. The creature has immunity
to necrotic and poison damage and to the poisoned
condition.
Toxic Demise. When the creature is reduced
to 0 hit points, it explodes in a burst of toxic mulch
or fetid viscera. Each creature within 5 feet of the
exploding creature must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw against your spell save DC or take
necrotic damage based on the creature’s challenge
rating (see the table below). As an action, you can

also cause a summoned creature to explode, immedi-
ately killing it.

Incarnation of Corruption
At 14th level, your physical form begins to take on
the tainted traits of the land you are bonded to. Your
skin grows ashen, and your eyes darken or turn
completely white. Spines and jagged spurs emerge
from your body, granting you resistance to necrotic
damage and a +2 bonus to AC.
Additionally, whenever you start your turn within
the radius of the corruption created by your Defile
Ground feature, you can use a bonus action to gain
temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
