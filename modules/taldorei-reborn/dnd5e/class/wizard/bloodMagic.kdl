Blood Magic
Considered taboo by many societies and magic
practitioners, the use of blood magic—also known
as hemocraft—is a rare art that harnesses the latent
powers of a creature’s vitality to fuel and amplify
the caster’s own capabilities, while manipulating
and weakening the bodies of enemies from the
inside. Some of the more macabre mages seeking
to empower their arcane pursuits turn to hemocraft
as a means of bolstering their spells, giving their
own life’s blood to reach new heights of frightening
magical prowess.
The secrets of hemocraft and other forms of blood

magic were once the sole purview of the mysteri-
ous Claret Orders. In recent years, however, these

secrets have begun to spread beyond the order’s
members and into the hands of less scrupulous
mages. Blood magic has a bad reputation in
Tal’Dorei, even though its powers can be used for
much more than evil.
Blood Channeling
When you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level,
you are able to use your own depleted life essence
to channel your magical abilities. Whenever your
current hit points are below your hit point maximum,
you can use your own body as an arcane focus.
In addition, when casting a wizard spell that
requires a costly material component, you can forego
the component by taking 1d10 necrotic damage per
50 gp of the cost of the component (minimum 1d10).
This damage can’t be reduced in any way. If this
damage reduces you to 0 hit points, the spell fails but
the spell slot is not expended.

Sanguine Burst
Also at 2nd level, you learn how to weave your life
force into a spell you cast, boosting its intensity at
the cost of your vitality. Whenever you roll damage
for a spell you’ve cast of 1st level or higher, you can
choose to take necrotic damage equal to the spell’s
level to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum one). This damage
can’t be reduced in any way, and you must use the
new rolls.
Bond of Mutual Suffering
At 6th level, when a creature you can see hits you
with an attack, you can use your reaction to bind
your vitality to the attacker and force them to share
your pain. The attacker takes damage equal to the
damage you took.
This feature cannot be used against constructs
or undead. You can use this feature once. You must
finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
At 14th level, you can use this feature twice
between rests.
Glyph of Hemorrhaging
Starting at 10th level, when you damage a creature
with a spell, you can choose to curse that creature
for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, whenever
the creature is hit by an attack, it takes an extra 1d6
necrotic damage. At the end of each of the creature’s
turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC, ending the curse on
a success.
This feature cannot be used against creatures
that are undead or constructs. Once you use this
feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short
or long rest.
Thicker than Water
Upon reaching 14th level, the blood that flows
through your veins is empowered with arcane vigor
that mends wounds and helps preserve your life.
Whenever a spell or magical effect causes you to
regain hit points, you regain an additional number of
hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
In addition, while you are concentrating on a spell,
you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
