Fortune’s Grace
Your fate-touched essence can cause events to shift

in your favor. When you make an attack roll, an abil-
ity check, or a saving throw, you can choose to reroll

the d20. You must reroll the die before the outcome
of the initial roll is determined.
Alternatively, when a creature you can see makes
an attack against you or makes a saving throw
against one of your spells or features, you can force
that creature to reroll the attack roll or saving throw.
If the roll that triggers the reroll is made with
advantage or disadvantage, both d20s are rerolled.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

Cruel

The challenges and struggles you’ve faced through-
out your life have led you to delight in inflicting pain

and anguish upon others. You gain a number of
cruelty dice equal to your proficiency bonus. Your
cruelty dice are d6s. You can roll only one cruelty die
per turn, and a cruelty die is spent when you roll it.

You can roll a cruelty die under any of the follow-
ing circumstances, with the indicated result:

• When you deal damage to a creature, spend one
cruelty die to deal extra damage to the creature
equal to the roll.
• When you score a critical hit, spend one cruelty die
to gain temporary hit points equal to the roll.
• When you make a Charisma (Intimidation)
check, spend one cruelty die and add the roll to
your check.
You regain all spent cruelty dice when you finish a
long rest.
Flash Recall
Prerequisite: Spellcasting feature from a class that
prepares spells
You’ve developed the ability to instantly recall an
unprepared spell in moments of sudden necessity.
As a bonus action, you prepare a spell of 1st level
or higher from your spellbook (if you’re a wizard) or
from your class spell list (if you’re not a wizard). This
spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots,
and it replaces another spell of an equal or higher
level that you had previously prepared.
Once you use this feat to recall a spell, you can’t do
so again until you complete a short or long rest.

Mystic Conflux
You possess an intuitive understanding of the way
magic ebbs and flows within enchanted items. Such
items attune easily to you, and you are able to sound
out their secrets. You gain the following benefits:
• You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
• You can cast the identify spell without expending a
spell slot or material components. You must finish
a long rest before you can do so again.
Remarkable Recovery
Your body has the ability to recover quickly from
terrible injuries, and is unusually receptive to healing
magic. You gain the following benefits:

• Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a max-
imum of 20.

• When you are successfully stabilized while dying,
you regain hit points equal to your Constitution
modifier (minimum of 1).
• Whenever you regain hit points as a result of a
spell, potion, or class feature (but not this feat), you

regain additional hit points equal to your Constitu-
tion modifier (minimum of 1).

Spelldriver

Prerequisites: Character level 11 or higher; Spellcast-
ing or Pact Magic feature

Through intense focus, training, and dedication,

you’ve harnessed the techniques of rapid spellcast-
ing. When you use your bonus action to cast a spell

of 1st level or higher, you can also use your action to
cast another spell of 1st level or higher. However, if
you cast two or more spells in a single turn, only one
of them can be 3rd level or higher.
Thrown Arms Master
You’ve honed your ability to lob weaponry into the

fray, including weapons not meant for ranged com-
bat. You gain the following benefits:

• Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to
a maximum of 20.
• Simple and martial melee weapons without the
thrown property have the thrown property for you.
One-handed weapons have a normal range of 20
feet and a long range of 60 feet, while two-handed
weapons have a normal range of 15 feet and a long
range of 30 feet.
• Weapons that already have the thrown property
increase their short range by 20 feet and their long
range by 40 feet for you.
• When you miss with a thrown weapon attack using
a light weapon, the weapon returns to your grasp
like a boomerang at the end of your turn, unless
something prevents it from returning. You can
catch and stow as many weapons as you threw
in this way.

Vital Sacrifice
You've learned secrets of hemocraft that grant you
esoteric power at the price of your own life force. As
a bonus action, you can choose to take 1d6 necrotic
damage to gain a blood boon. Your blood boon lasts
for 1 hour or until expended.
You can expend this blood boon to gain one of the
following benefits:
• When you make an attack roll, you roll 1d6 and
add it to the total.
• When you hit with an attack or spell, you deal an
additional 2d6 necrotic damage.
• When you cause a creature to make a Strength,
Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, roll a d4
and reduce their save by the amount rolled.
The damage you take to gain a blood boon can’t be
reduced in any way.
